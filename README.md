# syndromic-quality-rug
Code, data, markdown for ISDS R Users Group presentation, 2017-07-27. The presentation can be found here: http://rpubs.com/markhw/syndromic-quality. Additionally, a video recording of the presentation can be found here: https://vimeo.com/227438307.

Note: During the presentation, Aaron Kite Powell noted that the time zones used in the visits time and record arrival time are different. I left the code here as it appeared in the presentation, but I have updated the function (`va_lag`) in the `biosensequality` package to reflect this issue.
